These are the VERY BASIC rules I used in the video tutorial.

You should be extra careful to expand on these to further lock down your project.

For example, any logged in player could currently delete all the coins in the game - or write whatever they want to their individual `player` node.


```
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "true",
    ".write": "true"
  }
}
```
